    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Originally from Colombia, I have over 10 years of experience in IT and telecommunications, 
      blending technical expertise with administrative and process management skills. 
      I am proactive, detail-oriented, and quick to learn new technologies. 
      Since moving to Canada, I have been studying English and completing a Computer Programming Diploma at Algonquin College (requirements completed, graduation August 2025). 
      I am now seeking opportunities in software development, QA, and IT projects where I can contribute with my skills and grow professionally.
